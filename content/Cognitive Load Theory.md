# Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), proposed by **John Sweller (1988)**, explains why working memory capacity limits learning efficiency. Instructional design should therefore minimize unnecessary mental effort.

## Types of Load
- **Intrinsic load** – Complexity inherent to the task.  
- **Extraneous load** – Caused by poor instructional design (e.g., irrelevant details).  
- **Germane load** – Productive effort invested in schema construction.

## Applications
- Avoid split-attention effects by integrating text and visuals.  
- Chunk information to match working memory limits.  
- Scaffold learning by gradually increasing intrinsic load.

## Example
When students attempt to solve math word problems with extraneous background stories, performance decreases because of unnecessary processing demands.

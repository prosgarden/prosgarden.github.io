# Long-term Memory Formation

Learning depends on the successful transition of information into **long-term memory** (LTM). This process is influenced by [[202509031001 The Role of Attention in Learning]] and limited by [[202509031003 Cognitive Load Theory]].

## Stages of Memory
1. **Encoding** – Sensory input is transformed into meaningful representation.  
   - Emotional salience and personal relevance increase encoding strength.  
2. **Storage** – Information is consolidated in distributed neural networks.  
   - Sleep plays a critical role in consolidation.  
3. **Retrieval** – Accessing stored memories reinforces them and improves recall.  
   - Retrieval practice is more effective than re-reading.

## Neurological Basis
The **hippocampus** acts as a hub for initial memory storage before gradual transfer to the cortex. Neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and dopamine modulate this process.
